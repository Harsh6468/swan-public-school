# 🦢 Swan Public School  

I built this **responsive static website** as a **practice project** while learning **HTML** and **CSS**.  
The project helped me understand structure, styling, and responsiveness in web design.  

🌐 **Live Demo**: [Swan Public School](https://harsh6468.github.io/swan-public-school)

## ✨ What I Practiced
- 📑 Writing clean and semantic **HTML**  
- 🎨 Styling with **CSS** (colors, layouts, typography)  
- 📱 Making the site **responsive** for desktop and mobile  
- 🏗 Structuring a basic school-themed website
